# React + TypeScript + Vite

My first React App and TypeScript project. Used as a playground for me to learn how does react work and getting a feel of TypeScript.

for setup:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

P.S. Fetch your own playlist and API! currently using Youtube API and my personal Playlist.
